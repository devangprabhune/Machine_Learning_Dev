# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects by Devang Prabhune

Welcome to my collection of **Machine Learning and Data Science projects** — each crafted to strengthen core concepts, explore real-world datasets, and demonstrate practical implementation skills in Python.  

Every project folder contains:
- Clean, readable Jupyter notebooks
- Problem statements and dataset descriptions
- Visualizations, models, and interpretations
- A project-specific `README.md` for details
